# **DIY Lab: Detecting the Solar Wind with TEC-1 (Z80 SBC) & VLF Receiver**

## **Objective**
Detect and analyze variations in Earth's ionosphere caused by the solar wind using a **Very Low Frequency (VLF) receiver** and process the data with a **TEC-1 Z80 SBC**.

## **Background**
The **solar wind**â€”a stream of charged particles from the Sunâ€”affects Earth's **ionosphere**, altering how radio waves propagate. By monitoring a **VLF transmitter signal**, we can observe changes in signal strength and phase shifts that correlate with solar wind activity.

## **Materials Needed**
1. **TEC-1 SBC (Z80-based computer)** â€“ for data logging and analysis.
2. **VLF Receiver** (homemade or kit-based) â€“ to capture signals from stable VLF transmitters.
   - Example: **WWVB (60 kHz), NAA (24 kHz), or DHO38 (23.4 kHz)**
3. **Ferrite Rod or Loop Antenna** â€“ to pick up VLF signals.
4. **Audio Amplifier Module** â€“ for signal amplification.
5. **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** (e.g., **ADC0804**) â€“ to digitize the VLF signal for the TEC-1.
6. **Basic RF filters** â€“ for noise reduction.
7. **Power Supply** â€“ 5V & 12V for the circuits.
8. **Oscilloscope or SDR (Optional)** â€“ to visualize signals before sending them to the Z80.

## **Step 1: Building the VLF Receiver**
1. **Antenna Setup**: 
   - Wind **100-200 turns** of **magnet wire** around a ferrite rod or make a **loop antenna (1m diameter)**.
   - Connect to a high-impedance preamplifier.
   
2. **Tuning Circuit**:
   - Use a **LC resonant circuit** tuned to ~20-60 kHz.
   - Adjust capacitor values to maximize signal pickup from a chosen VLF station.

3. **Amplification**:
   - Use an **op-amp** (e.g., **TL072**) to boost the weak VLF signal.

4. **Demodulation**:
   - The signal is typically AM-modulated. A simple **diode detector** can extract envelope changes.

5. **Filtering & ADC Input**:
   - Filter out **high-frequency noise** with an **RC low-pass filter**.
   - Feed the signal into an **ADC0804 (8-bit ADC)**, interfaced with the TEC-1 SBC.

## **Step 2: Connecting the VLF Receiver to the TEC-1**
1. **Wiring the ADC to the TEC-1**
   - **ADC0804 Pinout**:
     - **Vin+** â†’ Filtered VLF signal output.
     - **Vin-** â†’ Ground.
     - **CS, RD, WR, INTR** â†’ Connected to TEC-1 **I/O ports (e.g., Port 3)**.
     - **DB0-DB7** â†’ Z80 **data bus**.

2. **Z80 Assembly Code to Read ADC**
   - This code reads the ADC data, storing signal strength over time.

```assembly
; TEC-1 ADC Read Routine
IN ADC_PORT       ; Read ADC value from port
MOV A, L          ; Store signal level
CALL STORE_DATA   ; Save for later analysis
JMP LOOP
```

3. **Logging and Displaying Data**
   - Display signal strength variations on the **TEC-1 7-segment display**.
   - Store data in memory for later analysis.

## **Step 3: Detecting Solar Wind Variations**
1. **Baseline Measurement**:
   - Record VLF signal levels over a 24-hour period.
   - Identify daily variations due to the **ionosphere's normal behavior** (e.g., night-day transitions).

2. **Solar Wind Effects**:
   - **Solar Flares or CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections)** cause **sudden changes** in the VLF signal.
   - **Increased signal absorption** during solar events = **lower signal strength**.
   - Compare data logs to **solar activity reports** from sources like NOAAâ€™s Space Weather Prediction Center.

---

## **Step 4: Analyzing Results**
- **Plot** signal variations vs. time using:
  - **TEC-1's display** (for simple monitoring).
  - **Dumping data to a PC via serial interface** for graphing.

- Compare with **solar wind speed/density data** from online sources.

---

## **Bonus: Expanding the Project**
- Use **two VLF receivers** at different locations to compare results.
- **Use an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module** to timestamp data.
- Build a **Z80-based data logger** for long-term monitoring.

## **Conclusion**
This DIY project enables real-time monitoring of **solar wind effects on Earth's ionosphere** using simple radio equipment and the **TEC-1 SBC**. By capturing VLF signal variations, we can **detect space weather events** and gain insights into solar activityâ€”**all from home!** ðŸš€ðŸ“¡
